/*
(Tokenizing Telephone Numbers) 
Write an application that inputs a telephone number as a 
string in the form (555) 555-5555. The application should use 
String method split to extract the area code as a token, the first three 
digits of the phone number as a token and the last four digits of the phone 
number as a token. The seven digits of the phone number should be concatenated into 
one string. Both the area code and the phone number should be printed. Remember that youâ€™ll 
have to change delimiter characters during the tokenization process.
