/*
 (Student Poll) 
 The program above contains an array of survey responses 
 thatâ€™s hard coded into the program. Suppose we wish to 
 process survey results that are stored in a file. This 
 exercise requires two separate programs. First, create an 
 application that prompts the user for survey responses and 
 outputs each response to a file. Use a Formatter to create a 
 file called numbers.txt. Each integer should be written using 
 method format. Then modify the program above  to read the survey 
 responses from numbers.txt. The responses should be read from 
 the file by using a Scanner. Use method nextInt to input one 
 integer at a time from the file. The program should continue 
 to read responses until it reaches the end of the file. The 
 results should be output to the text file "output.txt".
