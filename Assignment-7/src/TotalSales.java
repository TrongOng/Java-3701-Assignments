/*
 (Total Sales) 
Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem: 
A company has four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5). 
Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each type of product sold. 
Each slip contains the following:

The salesperson number
The product number
The total dollar value of that product sold that day

Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. 
Assume that the information from all the slips for last month is available. 
Write an application that will read all this information for last monthâ€™s 
sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson and by product. All totals 
should be stored in the two-dimensional array sales. After processing all the 
information for last month, display the results in tabular format, with each column 
representing a salesperson and each row representing a particular product. 
Cross-total each row to get the total sales of each product for last month. 
Cross-total each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month. 
Your output should include these cross-totals to the right of the totaled rows 
and to the bottom of the totaled columns.*/
